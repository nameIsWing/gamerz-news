                        <p>In their first day at the PGL Major Stockholm, Astralis fell short in both of their games against FaZe and Entropiq. The winless start is uncharacteristic of the Danish organization, who herald 4 total Major wins. Astralis have dug themselves in a hole with an 0-2 start. Though the journey is not yet over, the team will have to comeback much stronger day two.</p>
                        <p><strong>Astralis’ abysmal start – Can they come back?</strong></p>
                        <p>Astralis led off the PGL Major with their first game versus the Copenhagen Flames. Their fellow Danes were perhaps one of the most hyped dark horses coming into the tournament. The Flames dominated the single game on Overpass, winning 16-6.</p>
                        <p>Nicoodoz and roeJ led the charge for the Flames, finding a combined 45 kills. Unfortunately for Astralis, the second game against Entropiq didn’t go any better for the team. Once again, Astralis was kept below 6 round wins as the CIS squad knocked their opponents down on Dust2.</p>

                        <p>The PGL Major Stockholm will be the first CS:GO Major in nearly two years. This historic event will be one of the few LANs hosted in 2021. This historic event will take place from October 26th to November 7th. You can watch the Major from the official PGL Twitch account.</p>
                        <img src="./images/csgo-major.jpg" alt="csgo">
                        <p>The Major will follow the traditional format, being split into two distinct phases. The Challengers stage will be held from October 26th to the 29th. This section of the tournament will decide the 8 remaining spots in the PGL Major Stockholm main event. 16 teams will compete in a single round-robin group stage.</p>
                        <p>After the Challengers stage, the main event will begin on October 30th and end on November 7th. Called the Champions stage, this portion of the event will feature a single elimination bracket with a $2 million prize pool.</p>
                        <p>While not all of the teams have been decided, the Champions stage currently includes: Navi, G2, Team Liquid, Ninjas In Pyjamas, Vitality, Gambit, Furia, and Evil Geniuses. These teams were immediately slotted in through the RMRs while the rest will have to battle their way uphill to the main event.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Valve has released a new update for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which signifies an increased crack down in dealing with griefers on the ladder. If players get reported for griefing Valve will now sanction them faster with warning and even bans.</p>
                        <p>While some players are worried that mass reporting could be abused the new algorithm by Valve is stated to only consider “unusually high” amount of reportings to act upon.</p>
                        <p>Hopefully this change leads to a better environment around CS:GO servers.</p>

                    <h3>Updates to maps and ping issue solved for CS:GO in newest patch</h3>
                    <section>
                        <p>With the release of Broken Fang, CS:GO also implemented a brand new ping system, which now sees some changes following some issues. One of these issues was the abuse of pings, which highlighted enemies and allowed players to spam pings through smokes to find where enemies were hiding.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, a total of 4 maps received updates as well. These maps are Anubis, Apollo, Engage and Frostbite. The changes to Apollo and Frostbite were seemingly the most impactful ones, as some notorious exploits were removed, such as a spawn boost exploit, clipping issues and some spots where players were able to get stuck. Changes to Anubis and Engage were rather minor, fixing some grenade clips and a wallbang spot on the former while the latter received mostly fixes for visual issues alongside the removal of some boost spots.</p>
