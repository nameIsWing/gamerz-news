                        <p>Fighting games generally have an interesting quirk where their characters don't really age that much between new entries, but Tekken hasn't been as afraid of the passage of time.</p>
                        <p>During the latest episode of Harada's Bar, Director Katsuhiro Harada revealed the true ages of Kazuya, Heihachi, Asuka, Eliza and other fighters as of Tekken 7.</p>
                        <p>Responding to a fan question on their age and birthdays, Harada pulls up an internal document on his phone to look at the characters' full profiles, and the editors hilariously censor his eyes with a black bar because he can't be seen without his sunglasses now.</p>
                        <p>Kazuya is first up being revealed to be 49 years old in the latest game with Lee only being a year behind him.</p>
                        <p>Heihachi is definitely getting up there now considering Harada says he's 75 in Tekken 7, but he's nowhere close to the oldest fighter around at the moment.</p>
                        <p>The director jokes that Wang Jinrei would be 105 if he is even still alive because he hasn't been seen canonically since Tekken 6.</p>
                        <p>As for the current playable roster, however, Eliza seems to take the cake at around 500 years old, which makes sense as a vampire.</p>
                        <p>Although they've been around for almost 20 years in the real world at this point, Asuka and Lili are not full adults yet with Harada saying they're both about 17 still.</p>
                        <p>He also reveals Lili's birthday is November 11 simply because 11/11 looks like her name.</p>
                        <p>On top of that, the document also has fighters' blood types, which Japan uses in a similar manner to astrology in the West, and Harada jokes that he doesn't think Eliza has a blood type.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>After a video game has run its course with content and is all wrapped up, it is common practice for the company behind it to release a "complete" or "game of the year" edition that bundles up all of the DLC and added goodies into one full package for fans to buy at a lower price point. We see this all the time with fighting games, and these versions of the game make it easy for newcomers or those who waited to jump in and enjoy everything the title has to offer.</p>
                        <img src="./images/tekken7/tekken-2.webp" alt="tekken-1">
                        <p>Well, a new Tekken 7 release has been announced called Tekken 7 Legendary Edition that, at a glance, looks to be a "complete" edition, but upon closer examination isn't quite that. Those who opt to pick this one up will be getting the base game and eight out of the 15 DLC characters.</p>
                        <p>At the time of writing this, it appears that Tekken 7 Legendary Edition is only seeing a launch in Europe. The official Bandai Namco EU Twitter account made the announcement this morning alongside an image of the special new box art.</p>
                        <p>"Iconic characters from #TEKKEN return in a new box version of TEKKEN 7!" writes Bandai Namco EU. "The Legendary Edition includes the base game with a roster of 36 fighters and 8 previously released DLC characters from past TEKKEN games."</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>The fighting game community got its start in dark and loud arcades in the '90s, and while these game centers all but disappeared in the West, the scene remained strong in Japan until the past few years.</p>
                        <p>During the most recent episode of Harada's Bar, longtime Tekken director and Bandai Namco manager Katsuhiro Harada spoke at length about what it would take for the arcade culture to be properly revived and if that's even really possible at this point.</p>
                        <p>It's sad to think that arcades as we know them may largely cease to be, but there will always be those dedicated to keeping the experience alive because it's impossible to beat the feeling of them.</p>

                        <p>Offline events are finally back for the fighting game community, and this month saw one of the largest returns to form yet.</p>
                        <p>Pinnacle 2021 went down with most of the best players North America has to offer in attendance including EG|SonicFox, PG|Justin Wong, PG|Punk, EMG|Riddles, PG|Kizzie Kay, Supernoon, Flux, Jibrill and many more.</p>
                        <p>There was a monstrous 12 titles sharing the mainstage this year between Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition, Guilty Gear Strive, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Tekken 7, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Granblue Fantasy: Versus, BlazBlue: Central Fiction, Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[clr] and Soul Calibur 6.</p>
                        <p>Pinnacle also served as the first NA major for the newly released Melty Blood: Type Lumina as well as arguably Strive too.</p>
                        <p>The total prize pool topped $30,000 across all games where nearly 700 players showed up to compete in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</p>
