                                It's official – Team Spirit are the Dota 2 World
                                Champions. The Russian squad lifted the Aegis of
                                Champions at The International 10 after
                                defeating PSG.LGD 3-2. But just how did this
                                Cinderella story come to fruition?
                            </p>

                                It seems hard to believe now that Team Spirit
                                nearly didn't even make it to The International
                                10 after failing to secure enough Dota Pro
                                Circuit points during the regular season. The
                                team then found themselves down 2-1 in the
                                finals of the open qualifiers, just one game
                                away from never making it. Now they’re the
                                champions.

                                As expected Dota 2 has dropped a new bombshell
                                of an announcement, with the second season of
                                Dragon’s Blood and the introduction of Marci as
                                a hero.

                            <p>
                                First and foremost Dota 2 went on to announce
                                the second season of their animated series
                                Dragon’s Blood with a brand new trailer. The
                                series was quite a big success for both Valve
                                and Dota 2, with it receiving quite favorable
                                reviews and introducing a whole bunch of new
                                people to the game of Dota. Now we’ll be getting
                                that much needed second season, which is set to
                                drop in January.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Prior to the announcement, the Dota 2 community
                                was already full of speculation on the next hero
                                that’d be announced to make the game. Now we’ve
                                got confirmation that we’ll get some more
                                overlap between the animated series Dragon’s
                                Blood and the game itself, as popular character
                                Marci will be introduced as a hero. She’ll be
                                joining the game in fall.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While we now know Marci is joining, we don’t
                                really have a lot of information about her
                                strengths or abilities. In the trailer (and in
                                the show) she’s been shown to have tremendous
                                physical strength and seems to excel in physical
                                combat, which is most likely the way she’ll
                                battle in the game as well.

                                after it has plagued the meta for quite a while.
                                The bonus HP was reduced and now each activation
                                of the Disk will increase its cooldown up to 165
                                seconds. This should hopefully make the item
                                less attractive. Witch Blade was also nerfed in
                                its damage output. Besides tinkering with the
                                stats items like Silver Edge and Helm of the
                                Overlord were reworked and now need Crystalis
                                and Vladimir’s Offering respectively.

                                7.29d finally tackles Toss Buybacks among a
                                broad smattering of nerfs for the heroes and
                                items currently dominating the meta.

                                Roughly a month after 7.29c Valve have
                                implemented another minor patch to Dota 2. 7.29d
                                fixes Toss Buybacks after there have been a
                                surge of those during the Dota Pro Circuit in
                                recent times. Besides tackling that
                                long-standing bug (some even called it a feature
                                at this point) Icefrog also handed out nerfs to
                                heroes and items dominating the current meta.
